change from 1.7.4 to 1.8.0
 - cybermailing URLS now uses HTTPS
 - les fonctions sur site direct (sans redirection et réservées aux compte PRO) sont dépréciées.
 - definition of constants CYBER_TRACKVAR and CYBER_KEY are optional
change from 1.7.2 to 1.7.3
 - preferably use CybermailingClient (in talk/cybermailing_client.php) as main class instead of cyberMailing_connect (in talk/connect.php)
   which is depreacated conserverd for backward compatybility. The difference is that the new is used to build an object wheras the old
   one was using static function. Objects are more flexible for integration of this api client within other system (modules or plugins)  
 - removed redirect functionalities (this should not be part for cybermailing api client)
 - removed attemps to make asynchrone queries (to much dependent on environment), asynchronism will be obtained with javascript if future version
